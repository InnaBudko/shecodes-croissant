      <h3>Austrian origins</h3>
      <p>
        The origin of the croissant can actually be traced back to 13th century
        Austria, where it was called the kipferl, the German word for crescent.

        made it their own:

        If you were to order a kipferl in Austria today, you will most likely be
        given a cookie rather than a pastry, with the only resemblance to the
        croissant being its crescent shape.
